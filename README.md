# Scottish Garden Bird Classification App

This is a toy app used to identify common Scottish garden birds, built using fastai2 and Flask as part of the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course (https://course.fast.ai/). The app allows users to upload a picture and see what kind of bird (listed on the site) the model detects based on a resnet34-based CNN. Available at bird-app-dl2d09c0.herokuapp.com
